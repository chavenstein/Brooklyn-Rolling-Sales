## Analysis of the Brooklyn Rolling Housing Sales Data

* There were some key highlights I found when playing around and querying the data. Most houses classifed with a building.class.category of "FAMILY" sold in Brooklyn between May 2016 to April 2017 were under 5,000 gross square feet. Additionally, most houses sold were 5 million dollars or less. The greatest quantity of family homes sold in September 2016, with 54 houses sold. The zip code 11234 had the greatest number of family homes sold (622 in total) between May 2016 and April 2017. After a Google search on the zip code it includes a number of coastal attractions, including: Bergen Beach, Marine Park, and the Marine Park Golf Course. Conversely, zip code 11249 had the least family house sales (15) and was near the Williamsburg Bridge, East River, and the Music Hall of Williamsburg. All in all, this was a fun analysis!
